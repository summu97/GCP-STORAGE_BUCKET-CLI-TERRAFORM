* All log activities are stored in "/var/log/syslog" or /var/log/messages
* To Access Terraform Logs:
* When you run Terraform commands (like terraform apply), Terraform prints logs to the standard output (your terminal).
terraform apply | tee terraform-apply.log

*  Terraform Detailed Logging:
* You can enable detailed logging by setting the TF_LOG environment variable. This will provide more verbose output from Terraform, which can be useful for debugging.
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform apply

* To redirect these detailed logs to a file:
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform apply 2>&1 | tee terraform-debug.log

* To unset it:
unset TF_LOG
